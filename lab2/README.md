# Lab 2

There are the code and test cases for first lab `student II`.

Input format: In the first line, there is an integer $n$, which is the number of students. In each of the next $n$ lines, there is a string of name and several integers of students' scores, which are separated by commas. If the student doesn't take some course, the score will be filled with -1. The example input is in `test/case1.in`.

To build the program and run the test cases, just run the following commands:

```bash
./test.sh <case_id>
```
