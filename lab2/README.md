# Lab 2

There are the code and test cases for second lab `student II`.

Input format: In the first line, there is an integer $n$, which is the number of students. In each of the next $n$ lines, there is a string of name and several integers of students' course-score pairs like `course_name1:score1, course_name2:score2, ...`, which are separated by commas. If the student doesn't take some course, the score will be filled with N/A. The example input is in `test` directory.

To build the program and run the test cases, just run the following commands:

```bash
./test.sh <case_id>
```
